# Gemini Robot Pro

Gemini Robot Pro is a smart CLI-based file management assistant powered by Google's Gemini LLM. It allows you to perform file system operations (like finding, moving, and copying files) using natural language commands.

## Features

- **Natural Language Control**: Just tell the robot what to do (e.g., "Find all PDFs in my Documents folder and move them to a new 'backup' folder").
- **Smart Interpretation**: Uses Google's Gemini models to understand your intent and translate it into actionable tool calls.
- **Safety First**:
  - Previews actions before execution.
  - Requires explicit confirmation for file operations.
- **Tools**:
  - `find_files`: Recursive search with glob patterns.
  - `move_files`: Move multiple files to a specific destination.
  - `copy_files`: Copy files to a target directory.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- An [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API Key (for accessing Gemini models).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nirmalakhadka18/Gemini_Robot_Pro.git
   cd Gemini_Robot_Pro
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # Mac/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenRouter API key:
   ```env
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to start the interactive CLI:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Example Commands

- *"Find all .jpg files in the current folder."*
- *"Move all python files from downloads to the 'scripts' folder."*
- *"Copy the error logs to the backup directory."*

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point for the CLI application.
- `llm_client.py`: Handles communication with the OpenRouter API.
- `tool_set.py`: Defines the file system tools (search, move, copy).
- `interpreter.py`: Executes the tool calls generated by the LLM.
- `list_models.py`: Utility to list available models from OpenRouter.
